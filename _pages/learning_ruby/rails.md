## Ruby on Rails

Rails is an entire framework and teaching it is outside the scope of this project
as this project was only designed to teach Ruby.
That said I have learned Rails and taught it to multiple people so here are a few
helpful resources that I have used in the past.

This is an online course on Agile Development and Ruby on Rails taught be Armando Fox
and David Patterson at UC Berkeley. It is long and in depth but very thorough and well done:
[https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x-1](https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x-1)

Here is the official Ruby on Rails guide which is a very dense written resource and
contains a lot of useful documentation:
