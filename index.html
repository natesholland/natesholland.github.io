<h2>Engineering Manager</h2>

<p>
  I enjoy solving business problems through organizing teams
  and mentoring engineers to meet our customers' needs.
  I'm most in my element when I'm both challenged technically
  and working with people.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my experience is in web development, though I have
  dabbled in machine learning.
  I'm most comfortable with ruby, python, or react/javascript,
  in that order.
