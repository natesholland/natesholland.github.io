<h2> Software Developer - Team Lead</h2>

<p>
  I enjoy solving business problems largely through writing code,
  but also through designing processes and organizing teams for
  engineering organizations.
  I'm most in my element when I'm both challenged technically
  and working with people.
</p>
<p>
  Most of my experience is in web development, though I have
  dabbled in machine learning.
  I'm most comfortable when I am writing ruby, python, or javascript,
  in that order.
